	* TA: deadline UML + architecture deadline Friday 16th
	* TA: deadline design patterns & code Friday 23rd
	* what about our grade? TA: follow the rubric
	* TA: have more connections between microservices in UML component diagram
	* more details in architecture specification
	* think of using design patterns, and choose them, minimum 2 design patterns used,
	  more than 2 probably won't give more points, just select the 2 best ones

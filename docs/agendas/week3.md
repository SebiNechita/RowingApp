# Notes

## Backlog feedback
* Requirements are good, following the scenario
* Sprint planning, do the sprint retrospective for the next week
* Sprint issues
* Combine requirements by must, should & could
* Is cancelling an enrollment more important than "should"?
* Activity owner should be able to edit more stuff (edit activity, cancelling the offer)
* Think about more complex matching algorithm (with preferences)
* Think about how we implement different boat types with different rowers.

## UML diagram
* Methods which check the validity of the boat in rowing info (isValidBoat)
* D/U relations can be bidirectional
* Think, explain our architectural choices
* Go into more detail in each microservice. Can create UML diagrams for those as well.

## Other
* Warn the user if there are concurrent events
* Put much effort in the issues, so everything is stated in detail, nothing is vague while coding.
* Estimate how much each issue is going to take (weights). Divide it evenly. Put how much work you put into implementing each issue.
* Do not spend too much time on security. Follow the template. 
* We can use usernames as IDs
* Send the next agenda with questions by Friday
* Let the admin delete old activities.

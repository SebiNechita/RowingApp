-----

## Communication
* Everyone must respect each other
* We need to be well-behaved during all the meetings (no bullying, harassing, intimidation and other non-constructive behaviours
* We meet internally at least once a week
* We publish all of our notes in a dedicated WhatsApp channel so that everybody has access to them
* We schedule our internal meetings by consensus
* We also assign roles by consens
* We do not talk over somebody else, we speak one at a time, so that everybody has the opportunity to express their issues and ideas.
* When reaching a consensus is impossible, a majority vote will decide upon the matter.
* We are expected to answer within ~12 hours to internal questions/messages (during the week) - there can be exemptions (person is sick or traveling etc.)
* On campus meetings: Tuesdays and whenever necessary
* If one cannot come to the above meeting they will need to announce the other team members in advance and a new meeting will be announced through consensus at least one day in advance
* Discord meeting at chosen times, whenever necessary
## Code
* At least two other people need to approve a merge request before it goes into master
* All branches (and also commits and merge requests) need to have concise and descriptive names, description and a related issue
* A merge request can only be approved if it has proper Java doc comments, it is properly tested and it has the right coding style - we will all use IntelliJ checkstyle
* A single feature will be enough to be done in one branch.
* We will have a Development branch where we will merge new individual features
* We will merge the Development branch into Main once a week, preferably before the weekly TA meeting
* We should merge the branches as soon as possible.
* We will split the tasks on a consensus and decide on what every branch should contain.
* Issues can be divided into smaller issues and assigned to one or more members
## Assignments
* Merge requests should be accepted & merged into master at least 1 day before deadline
* We will review (check) the assignment before handing it in
* Look and review the changes in a Merge Request before approving
* At the beginning of the week we announce on a discord channel what we are going to work on in that week, so that the other members know what to expect from each other.
* After one has completed a task, they need to tick the task in the GitLab agenda
* Documents including pictures, schemas etc. need to be in .pdf format, otherwise they will be in .md format
## Expectations
* We want to implement all 'must' and 'should' backlog features.
* Depending on our time, we would also like to implement at least some 'could' features
